1.  **Finding Biggest and Smallest Number:**
    * Develop an Android application that takes three numbers as input through `EditText` controls.
    * Implement logic to determine the biggest and smallest among the three input numbers.
    * Display the biggest and smallest numbers using a `Toast` control.

2.  **Simple and Compound Interest Calculation:**
    * Develop an Android application to calculate simple and compound interest.
    * Provide `EditText` controls for inputting the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.
    * Implement functionality to compute both simple and compound interest (with and without the principal amount in the final result).
    * Display the calculated interest (and total amount for compound interest with principal) using `Toast` controls.

3.  **Postfix Expression Evaluation:**
    * Develop an Android application that takes a postfix expression as input through an `EditText` control.
    * Implement an algorithm to evaluate the given postfix expression.
    * Display the result of the evaluation using a `Toast` control.

4.  **Simple Arithmetic Operations:**
    * Develop an Android application to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
    * Provide `EditText` controls for inputting two numbers.
    * Include buttons or other UI elements to select the desired arithmetic operation.
    * Display the result of the operation in another `EditText` control.

5.  **HCF and LCM using Popup Menus:**
    * Develop an Android application that takes two numbers as input through `EditText` controls.
    * Implement a popup menu with options to calculate:
        * HCF (Highest Common Factor)
        * LCM (Least Common Multiple)
    * Upon selecting an option from the popup menu, calculate and display the corresponding result (HCF or LCM) using a `Toast` control.

6.  **Factorial and Fibonacci Series using Options Menu:**
    * Develop an Android application that takes a number as input through an `EditText` control.
    * Implement an options menu with the following options:
        * Compute Factorial: Calculate the factorial of the input number.
        * Generate Fibonacci Series: Generate the Fibonacci series up to the input number.
    * Display the calculated factorial or the generated Fibonacci series using a `Toast` control.

7.  **Age Calculation:**
    * Develop an Android application using Java.
    * Take the user's name and date of birth as input (consider using appropriate input methods like `EditText` for name and `DatePicker` for date of birth).
    * Calculate the user's age in years, months, and days based on the provided date of birth.
    * Display the name and calculated age (in years, months, and days) using a `Toast` control.

8.  **SQLite Database Operations:**
    * Develop an Android application using Java to demonstrate SQLite database operations.
    * Implement functionality to:
        * Create an SQLite database and a table with appropriate columns.
        * Insert data into the table.
        * Access and retrieve data from the table.
        * Manipulate data in the table (e.g., update, delete).
    * Display the results of these database operations (e.g., success messages, retrieved data) using appropriate UI elements (e.g., `TextView`, `ListView`, `Toast`).
